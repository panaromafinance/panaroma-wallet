# How can you monitor the status of incoming/outgoing Bitcoin transactions?

 Panaroma Decentralized Wallet offers users the ability to track the status of their transactions through various stages:

- Upon sending a Bitcoin transaction, it promptly appears in the Transactions tab with a 'pending' status for both the sender and recipient. This status persists until the transaction is incorporated into the blockchain.

- Once included in the blockchain, the transaction status shifts to 'sending' for the sender and 'receiving' for the recipient. This event marks the transaction's first confirmation.

- The wallet app maintains the 'sending' status for the sender and 'receiving' status for the recipient until a minimum of 3 blocks have been added to the blockchain (equivalent to 3 confirmations).

- During this confirmation period,  Panaroma Decentralized does not reflect the transaction amount in the recipient's balance and restricts the recipient from spending the received funds in other transactions.

- Additionally, users can utilize publicly available Bitcoin block explorers, such as https://btc.com, to monitor the status of pending transactions. To track transactions on external resources, users need the transaction ID, which can be obtained from  Panaroma Decentralized Wallet.
