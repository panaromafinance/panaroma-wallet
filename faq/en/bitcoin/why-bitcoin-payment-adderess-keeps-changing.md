# Why does the Bitcoin payment address keep changing?

In Panaroma Decentralized, the address used to receive Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dash cryptocurrencies changes after each received transaction in that specific cryptocurrency. This dynamic address behavior is implemented by Panaroma Decentralized to enhance user privacy. 

The practice of changing the receiving address after each transaction is designed to increase privacy by preventing the linkage of all incoming transactions to a single address. If a user were to consistently use the same address for all incoming transactions, it could potentially expose their entire transaction history and balance, making it publicly accessible. 

By generating a new receiving address for each transaction, Panaroma Decentralized makes it more challenging for external entities to associate multiple transactions with the same user. This enhances the overall privacy and security of the user's cryptocurrency transactions. 

It's essential to note that all previously used addresses remain valid even after they have been used. Funds sent to any of these past addresses will still be received by the user. The addresses do not expire, providing flexibility and continuity for users while maintaining a higher level of privacy in their cryptocurrency transactions.
