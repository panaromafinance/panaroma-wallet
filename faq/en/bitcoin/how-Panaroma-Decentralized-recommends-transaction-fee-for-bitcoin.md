# How does Panaroma Decentralized recommend the transaction fee for Bitcoin?

Non-custodial wallets like  Panaroma Decentralized provide an estimated transaction fee amount for Bitcoin transactions to ensure they are included in the next block on the blockchain. The fee recommendation feature offers various levels based on the urgency of the transaction:

- Low: Estimated confirmation within 400 minutes.
- Recommended: Estimated confirmation within 120 minutes.
- High: Estimated confirmation within 30 minutes.
- Custom: User-defined value.
As a general guideline, opting for a higher fee (above the 'Recommended' setting) is advisable for transactions with high urgency or substantial transaction amounts. Conversely, selecting a very low fee, such as 0.01$, may result in the transaction being dropped or rejected shortly after being sent to the network.

The 'Custom' setting allows users to manually set their own transaction fee rate, suitable for those who are familiar with the Bitcoin transaction fee mechanism.

It's important to note that the  Panaroma Decentralized fee recommendation service is an educated guess based on network activity analysis. There is no guarantee that the recommended setting will always work as expected, as network conditions can change dynamically.

Additionally, the transaction fee amount is independent of the quantity of Bitcoins being transacted. The fee is more related to factors like network congestion, urgency, and the chosen fee level. Users should stay informed about network conditions and adjust fees accordingly, especially when there are variations in transaction urgency or network activity.
