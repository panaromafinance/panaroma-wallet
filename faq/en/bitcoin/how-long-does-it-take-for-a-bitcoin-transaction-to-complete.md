# How long Bitcoin transaction takes?

Bitcoin transactions undergo processing and are added to the Bitcoin blockchain approximately every 10 minutes in blocks sized at 1MB, accommodating a few thousand recently initiated transactions.

The completion of a transaction is contingent upon the inclusion of the block it belongs to in the blockchain. While the typical duration for a transaction to be included is around 10 minutes, it can occasionally extend to 20-30 minutes or even hours. This variability hinges on the load of the Bitcoin network and the fee amount set by the sender.

The transaction process unfolds as follows:

1. The sender initiates a transaction from the  Panaroma Decentralized wallet app. The transaction swiftly enters the Bitcoin network, becoming pending until a network node (miner) opts to validate and incorporate it into the blockchain.

2. The Bitcoin network may experience a backlog of pending transactions that surpass the capacity of 1MB blocks generated every 10 minutes. Consequently, network nodes must prioritize which transactions make it to the next block.

3. Given the surplus of pending transactions, network nodes prioritize those with higher fees. Transaction fees serve as economic incentives for network nodes, compelling them to prioritize transactions offering increased fees.

4. Transactions may linger in a 'pending' state for hours or days until the network experiences reduced congestion, and the initially set transaction fees become adequate for processing in the subsequent batch.

5. To ensure the completion of the transaction within desired level of urgency, the transaction fee should be set taking into account the load on the Bitcoin network.
