# When a Bitcoin transaction considered final?

While a Bitcoin transaction is considered confirmed once it has been added to the blockchain, it's not considered final (irreversible) until a few more transaction blocks are added to the blockchain. 

In other words, to deem a transaction final and permanent, it's advisable to wait for 5 additional blocks (about 50 minutes) after the block holding the original transaction. 

Here's a general rule to consider for transaction finality:               

 - For smaller payments, it's generally safe to consider the transaction final as soon as it's included in the blockchain. 

- For mid-sized payments (above $10,000), it's recommended to wait at least 3 blocks. Panaroma Decentralized wallet will display the transaction as final after 3 blocks. 

- For larger payments, it's suggested to wait for 6 blocks, although users can be reasonably certain after 3 blocks have passed.
