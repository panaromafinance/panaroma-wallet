# Why did the Bitcoin balance not increase after receiving payment?


In Panaroma Decentralized, the reflection of a Bitcoin payment on the wallet's balance is contingent on the payment receiving at least three confirmations on the Bitcoin network. The term "confirmation" refers to the number of blocks added to the blockchain after the block containing the given transaction.

For a payment to be considered final and reflected in the wallet's balance, it must have received at least three confirmations. This typically involves the addition of at least two more blocks to the blockchain after the block containing the specific transaction.

Users can track the confirmation status of a payment within the Panaroma Decentralized app. Additionally, they have the option to use a public Bitcoin block explorer, utilizing the unique transaction ID associated with the payment, to monitor the confirmation count on the blockchain.

This practice aligns with the standard security measures in the Bitcoin network, where waiting for confirmations ensures a higher level of confidence in the validity and permanence of transactions before considering them as finalized and updating the wallet's balance accordingly.
