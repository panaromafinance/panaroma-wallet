# Is it safe to share Bitoin payment address with others?

Absolutely, you've captured the essence of the privacy-preserving mechanism implemented by wallets like Panaroma Decentralized when it comes to Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies.

Sharing a Bitcoin address to receive payments is a standard practice, but using the same address for repeated transactions can potentially compromise user privacy. This is because anyone with knowledge of the address could look up past transactions associated with it on the public Bitcoin blockchain, potentially exposing the user's transaction history and balance.

To mitigate this privacy concern, wallets like Unstoppable implement a mechanism that allows Bitcoin wallets to generate an unlimited number of addresses. All these addresses are derived from the wallet's private key. By using a new address for each transaction, the user's transaction history becomes more challenging to trace, enhancing privacy.

Importantly, when a user migrates from one wallet app to another, the destination app can derive all the addresses that the wallet ever had, allowing it to check which of these addresses have received transactions. This ensures continuity and compatibility when users switch between wallet applications while maintaining the privacy benefits associated with using unique addresses for each transaction.
