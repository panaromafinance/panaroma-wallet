# Why can't I send Bitcoins that were just received?

In Panaroma Decentralized, the ability to spend newly received Bitcoins is contingent upon the original transaction receiving three confirmations on the blockchain. This practice is in place to ensure the security and validity of transactions before allowing the use of newly acquired funds in subsequent transactions.

Once a transaction has been initiated and has received three confirmations on the blockchain, Panaroma Decentralized enables users to utilize the received funds for new transactions. The confirmation count is a measure of the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain since the transaction was initiated.

Typically, with an adequate transaction fee, this process of receiving three confirmations can take approximately 30 to 40 minutes from the time the initial transaction was sent. Users can monitor the confirmation count directly within the Panaroma Decentralized app or through a public Bitcoin block explorer by using the unique transaction ID associated with the original transaction.

This waiting period and confirmation requirement contribute to the overall security and reliability of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus and confirms the validity of the transaction before allowing further use of the received funds.
