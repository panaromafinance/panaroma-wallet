# Why does the Bitcoin transaction stay pending?

A frequent reason for a transaction to linger in a pending state for an extended duration is network congestion, especially when the fee set for the transaction is below the network average. 

If the fee set is exceptionally low (close to 0), the transaction is expected to fail and be rejected, usually shortly after it's initiated.  

In cases where the sender's fee is below the network average, owing to a sudden surge in blockchain activity, the transaction is likely to stay pending for a considerable period but should eventually be processed. This process might take a few days.
