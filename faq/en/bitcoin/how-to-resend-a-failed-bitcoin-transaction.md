# How do you resend a failed Bitcoin transaction?

In the event of a failed (rejected) transaction status in Panaroma Decentralized, it's advisable to verify its status using a public block explorer such as https://btc.com by searching for the transaction ID. 

If it turns out that Panaroma Decentralized indicates a transaction as failed, but the public block explorer shows it as pending or confirmed, the issue likely lies within Panaroma Decentralized. In such cases, users should refrain from attempting to resend these transactions to prevent double sends and report the problem to Panaroma Decentralized wallet support for further investigation. 

A transaction should be deemed failed only if both Panaroma Decentralized and the public block explorer indicate it as failed or rejected.
