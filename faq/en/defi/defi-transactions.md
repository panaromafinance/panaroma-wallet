# How To Monitor WalletConnect transactions

Certainly! Just like regular token transfers and swaps, DeFi transactions executed via WalletConnect will also be tracked in the Transactions tab of the Panaroma Decentralized wallet. In the transactions list, these transactions will typically appear as 'Contract Call' but may also have a more descriptive name such as 'Sushiswap Pool Deposit' based on the specific action taken.  

Users can monitor the status of these transactions directly within the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app. Additionally, if they want more detailed information or want to explore the transaction on a public blockchain explorer, they can use services like Etherscan for Ethereum transactions. The transaction ID associated with each DeFi transaction can be used to look up details on the blockchain explorer, providing insights into the transaction status, confirmations, and other relevant information.
