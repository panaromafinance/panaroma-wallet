# Why Panaroma Decentralized supports only DEXes?

As of now, Panaroma Decentralized wallet supports the following decentralized exchanges: 

- Uniswap:  

- Supported Trades: ETH <> ERC20 / ERC20 <> ERC20 

- PancakeSwap: 

- Supported Assets: BNB <> BEP20 / BEP20 <> BEP20 

- 1inch Aggregator: 

- Supported Assets: ETH <> ERC20, ERC20 <> ERC20, BNB <> BEP20, BEP20 <> BEP20 

These DEX integrations enable users to trade assets within the ecosystem of a single blockchain. Uniswap is utilized for trading Ethereum (ETH) for various ERC20 tokens like USDT, UNI, AAVE, etc. PancakeSwap is employed for trading Binance Smart Chain-based assets (BEP20). 

The 1inch aggregator serves the purpose of allowing traders to split a single trade order between multiple exchanges within the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain ecosystem for optimal pricing. 

Panaroma Decentralized wallet has future plans to integrate with the Thorchain decentralized exchange. This integration would facilitate decentralized token swaps between various asset types, including BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEC, BCH, BNB, ERC20, and BEP20 tokens. Thorchain integration is expected to enhance the wallet's capabilities by enabling convenient decentralized trading across different blockchains.
