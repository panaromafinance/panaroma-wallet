# What are cryptocurrency swaps?

The Panaroma Decentralized wallet seamlessly integrates the functionality to exchange one cryptocurrency token for another through decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX). 

 Here are key features of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX): 

1. Non-Custodial Trading: 

 - DEX operates on smart contract-enabled blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) and facilitates non-custodial trading. 

- Users maintain control of their funds throughout the trading process. 

2. Token Swapping: 

- Users have the ability to swap or trade one cryptocurrency token for another on DEX. 

- Token swaps occur privately and unconditionally. 

3. User Control: 

  - Users directly trade against the DEX without the need for an intermediary. 

- The decentralized nature of DEX ensures that users have control over their assets. 

4. DEX as Maker and Taker: 

- DEX functions as both the maker and taker for supported token trades, allowing for flexibility in trading strategies. 

5. Swap Fee: 

- DEX typically charges a swap fee for facilitating token exchanges. The fee may range between 0.2% to 0.4% of the transaction amount. 

6. Independence and Autonomy: 

- DEXes operate independently and autonomously on the blockchain, providing a decentralized and trustless environment for token trading. 

7. Open and Unconditional Access: 

- Access to DEX is open to anyone, and participation is unconditional. Users can engage in token trading without restrictions. 

The integration of DEX functionality within the Panaroma Decentralized wallet enhances the user experience by providing a secure, private, and decentralized platform for cryptocurrency token exchanges.
