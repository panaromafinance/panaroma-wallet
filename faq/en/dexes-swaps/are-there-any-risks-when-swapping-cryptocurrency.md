# Are there any risks when swapping cryptocurrency?

When executing swap trades on Panaroma Decentralized wallet, users are guided through the process with simplified steps, but there are important considerations: 

1. Cost of Swap Transaction: 

- Users pay both a transaction fee (to the Ethereum blockchain miner) and a swap fee (to the DEX settling the order). 

- Ethereum network congestion can result in high transaction fees, making Binance Smart Chain a more cost-effective option. 

- DEXes generally charge around 0.3% of the swap amount. 

2. Transaction Deadline: 

- A swap transaction is valid for about 20 minutes after submission. 

- On busy blockchains like Ethereum, a sufficient transaction fee is crucial for processing within the deadline. 

- A low fee may lead to a pending state beyond the deadline, resulting in a failed swap action, still incurring network fees. 

3. Price Slippage: 

- Price slippage is the difference in token price between order placement and transaction completion due to market changes. 

- Panaroma Decentralized estimates potential slippage, and users can set acceptable slippage levels. 

- Setting excessively low slippage may cause transaction failure due to an inability to execute within the indicated slippage.
