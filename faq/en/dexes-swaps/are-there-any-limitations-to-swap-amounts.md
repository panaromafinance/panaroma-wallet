# Are there limits to swap amounts?

Users have the freedom to swap cryptocurrencies on a decentralized exchange (DEX) as much as they desire, provided there is sufficient liquidity available.

However, it is strongly recommended that users thoroughly review the risks associated with swapping before executing any transactions. Each swap involves certain considerations, and users should be aware of potential challenges.

It's crucial to note that the amount of liquidity available on a decentralized exchange may not always be adequate to cover larger trades, particularly when dealing with less popular tokens. To mitigate this risk, users are encouraged to compare the swap prices on a decentralized exchange with those on centralized exchanges like Binance before finalizing a trade. This comparison helps users make informed decisions and ensures they are getting the most favorable terms for their transactions.
