# Are there any risks when using Panaroma Decentralized Wallet? 

Panaroma Decentralized ensures that the user has complete autonomy over their funds, with no capacity for interference or restrictions from the app. The user maintains exclusive control and responsibility for their assets in this non-custodial, private, and decentralized wallet. 

With no external custodian overseeing fund safety, users bear full responsibility for the security of their assets. Panaroma Decentralizedâ€™s key features operate independently of centrally managed servers or infrastructure managed by the Panaroma Decentralized team. 

While Panaroma Decentralized open code allows for transparency and scrutiny, potential risks may arise, such as unexpected software bugs. Users should exercise good security practices, avoiding actions like rooting the phone or neglecting device PIN locks, to mitigate such issues.  

It is crucial to download or update the Panaroma Decentralized app only from official resources to prevent using unofficial versions. Additionally, users should be mindful of incorrect metadata within the app, like outdated exchange rates, and consider entering payment amounts in cryptocurrency rather than its fiat equivalent for more accurate transactions.  

A paramount reminder is never to share wallet private keys (12-24 word mnemonic phrase) with anyone, including the Panaroma Decentralized team. Any potential concerns with the wallet app can be resolved without disclosing the wallet private key. Security remains a shared responsibility between the user and the Panaroma Decentralized platform.
