# What happens if the Panaroma Decentralized app goes down? 

The functionality of the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app is independent of centrally managed servers, ensuring continuous operation as long as there is an internet connection. 

However, an exception lies in the ability to transact on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, as this process relies on RPC providers. Presently, achieving fully decentralized communication with these blockchains on mobile devices poses challenges, and this feature is yet to be implemented. 

Panaroma Decentralized has future plans to empower users by allowing them to utilize their own RPC provider, reducing dependence on external sources.  

Should the Panaroma Decentralized wallet face unexpected issues, users have the option to seamlessly migrate their wallets to another non-custodial app that complies with industry standards.
