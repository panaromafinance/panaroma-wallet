Exercise caution and trust only official channels. Beware of fake groups and channels impersonating the Panaroma Decentralized team on platforms like Telegram and Twitter. 

 Under no circumstances should you share your wallet private keys (12-24 word mnemonic) with anyone, including the Panaroma Decentralized team. All issues with the wallet app can be addressed without disclosing your private key. 

  

When reporting a problem with the wallet app, please provide the following: 

- App Status logs with the message, located in Settings >> About App >> App Status. Sharing these logs is secure and aids in effective troubleshooting.  

- If the issue involves a transaction, include the public transaction ID found by clicking on the respective transaction on the Transactions page. 

  
- Always prioritize the security of your wallet by refraining from sharing private keys with anyone.
