# Who's building the Panaroma Decentralized wallet?

 Panaroma Decentralized was established in 2017 and is being developed by the team.

Comprising 16 individuals skilled in engineering and creativity, the team exhibits a profound passion for borderless fintech and the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

Having engaged in various Software as a Service (SaaS) ventures and fintech activities since 2013, the team made a dedicated shift to the cryptocurrency and fintech sector in 2017. This decision was prompted by encountering challenges within traditional finance, both on a business and individual level.

The team's pivot to the crypto realm was a direct response to the limitations experienced in conventional financial systems. Motivated by these challenges, they were drawn to the compelling idea of constructing a decentralized asset storage and management tool that operates independently of traditional financial structures.
