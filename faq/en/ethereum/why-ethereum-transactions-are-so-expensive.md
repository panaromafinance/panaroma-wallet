# Why Ethereum fees are so high?


You've provided a comprehensive overview of the various transaction types that can occur on the Ethereum blockchain and highlighted how the complexity of transactions influences the associated transaction fees. Here's a recap:

Transaction Types on Ethereum:

- Transfer of ETH from one address to another.
- Transfer of ERC20 tokens from one address to another.
- Exchanging ERC20 tokens for another ERC20 token.
- Borrowing ERC20 tokens from a borrowing service.
- And various other transaction types.
- Factors Affecting Transaction Fees:

The key parameter influencing transaction fees is the complexity of the individual transaction.
More complex transactions involve more computational steps.
Higher computational steps result in higher transaction fees.
Transaction Complexity and Fees:

The simplest and typically cheapest transaction type on Ethereum is the plain transfer of Ethereum tokens (ETH).
In contrast, transactions involving the exchange of one token for another are more complex and usually cost several times more than simple ETH transfers.
Fee Independence from Transaction Amount:

The transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain is not dependent on the amount of Ethereum or tokens being transacted.
Instead, it is primarily influenced by the computational complexity of the transaction.
Understanding these dynamics helps users make informed decisions about transaction fees based on the type and complexity of the transactions they wish to perform on the Ethereum network. It also highlights the importance of considering transaction complexity when estimating fees for various operations on the blockchain.
