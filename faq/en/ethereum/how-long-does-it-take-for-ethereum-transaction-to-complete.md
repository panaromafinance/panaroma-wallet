# How long Ethereum transaction takes?

Similar to Bitcoin, a transaction on Ethereum is considered complete when a block containing the specific transaction has been added to the Ethereum blockchain. 

As with Bitcoin, the duration of an Ethereum transaction is influenced by the network's load and the fee amount set by the sender. In times of high transaction volume on Ethereum, users may need to pay higher fees to ensure their transaction is included in one of the upcoming blocks. 

 Panaroma Decentralized provides an estimated transaction fee amount to facilitate inclusion in the next few blocks. A recommended fee value is generally sufficient for completing a transaction within 10-20 minutes, although no guarantees can be provided. 

If a user sets transaction fees significantly below the current average on the Ethereum network, transactions may linger in a pending state for extended periods until the network congestion subsides.
