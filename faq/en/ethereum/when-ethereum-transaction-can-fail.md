# When Ethereum transaction can fail?

You've highlighted two common error reasons for Ethereum transactions:

- Dropped and Replaced Error:
This error occurs when a transaction is dropped and replaced by a new one.
More information about the dropped and replaced transaction can be found at https://info.etherscan.com/transaction-dropped-replaced/.
This situation often arises in the context of replacing a transaction with a higher gas fee to expedite its processing.

- Out of Gas Error:
An "Out of Gas" error occurs when the gas limit for a transaction is set too low.
Further insights into understanding the gas limit can be found at https://ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/.
It's important to set an appropriate gas limit to ensure that a transaction has sufficient gas to execute all its computational steps on the Ethereum network.

Understanding these error reasons is crucial for Ethereum users to troubleshoot and address issues that may arise during transaction processing. Adjusting gas fees and gas limits appropriately can help enhance the chances of successful and timely transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
