# Why does the Ethereum transaction stay pending?


You've outlined two common reasons why a transaction might remain in a pending state for an extended period of time:

1. Low Transaction Fee: One of the primary reasons for a transaction to be pending is if the transaction fee is below the network average. In busy periods, when there is high demand for network resources, transactions with lower fees may not be prioritized by miners. As network activity decreases, these transactions are more likely to be confirmed.

2. Prior Pending Transactions: In the context of Ethereum, transactions are processed sequentially. If a user has another pending transaction, it needs to be completed or replaced before subsequent transactions from the same user can take place. This ensures that transactions are processed in the order they are submitted and avoids potential conflicts or double-spending issues.

3. Both of these reasons highlight the importance of transaction fees and network congestion in determining the speed at which a transaction is processed. Users may need to adjust their transaction fees based on network conditions to ensure timely processing. Additionally, being mindful of the order and status of pending transactions is crucial for understanding why a particular transaction may be delayed.
