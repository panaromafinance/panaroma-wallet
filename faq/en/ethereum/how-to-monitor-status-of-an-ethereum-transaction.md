# How to monitor Ethereum transaction?

 Panaroma Decentralized Wallet provides users with the capability to track the status of their Ethereum transactions through various stages:

1. Pending Status: Right after a user sends an Ethereum transaction, it promptly appears with a 'pending' status on the Transactions tab.

2. Confirmation Status: The status of the transaction transitions to 'sending' for the sender and 'receiving' for the recipient as soon as it becomes included in the blockchain. This event marks the transaction's first confirmation.

3. Confirmation Process: The wallet app maintains the 'sending' status for the sender and 'receiving' status for the recipient until a minimum of 10 blocks have been added to the blockchain, corresponding to 10 confirmations.

4. Completion Status: Following the completion of 10 confirmations, the status changes to 'completed,' indicated by a checkmark along with a timestamp.

In addition to monitoring transaction status within  Panaroma Decentralized Wallet, users have the option to use publicly available Ethereum block explorers, such as https://etherscan.io, for additional monitoring. To do so, users can simply search for the transaction ID on a public block explorer dedicated to the Ethereum blockchain.
