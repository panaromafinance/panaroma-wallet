# When is an Ethereum transaction considered final?

Although an Ethereum transaction is deemed completed and confirmed once it is included in the blockchain, it is not considered final until additional blocks are added to the blockchain thereafter.

To ensure the finality and permanence of an Ethereum transaction, it is advisable to wait for approximately 11 more blocks, which typically takes about 3 minutes, after the block containing the transaction has been added to the blockchain. This waiting period helps enhance the confidence in the transaction's solidity and reduces the likelihood of any potential reorganizations or changes to the blockchain.
