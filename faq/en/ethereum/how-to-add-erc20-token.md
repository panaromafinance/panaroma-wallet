# How to add an ERC20 token to a balance

Users have the option to add any Ethereum-based ERC20 token to the wallet through the Coin Manager icon located on the balance tab.

Within the Coin Manager screen, users can follow two approaches:

1.Search and Activate: Users may search for the desired ERC20 token and activate it directly.

2. Add Token Manually: Alternatively, users can manually add a token by selecting the "Add Token" option. To do this, users need to input the ERC20 contract address of the specific token they want to add.

This manual addition process allows users to include ERC20 tokens in their wallet for tracking and managing various tokens associated with the Ethereum blockchain.
