# Why failed transactions consume fees

You've provided a comprehensive explanation of the intricacies associated with completed transactions on the blockchain, and it's worth emphasizing a few key points:

1. Confirmation and Blockchain Inclusion: A transaction is considered completed when it has been confirmed and added to the blockchain. Confirmation ensures that the network reaches a consensus that the transaction is valid.

2. Execution Success vs. Transaction Completion: While a transaction may be completed and added to the blockchain, it doesn't guarantee the successful execution of all intended steps. For example, in token swaps, a transaction may have a validity period, and if it remains pending for confirmation longer than this period, the intended token exchange may not occur.

3. Failed Transactions and Transaction Fees: Failed transactions are also added to the blockchain, and they consume transaction fees. Miners receive these fees for the computational work they perform, irrespective of whether the transaction succeeds or fails. Network miners invest computational power in validating and processing every transaction, even though they cannot predict the outcome.

4. Transaction Fees are Network Payments: Transaction fees are paid directly to the network and do not pass through or relate to the  Panaroma Decentralized wallet in any way. Users are essentially compensating network miners for the resources expended in processing their transactions.

Understanding these aspects is crucial for users to have realistic expectations about the nature of blockchain transactions, including the potential for failed transactions and the associated costs incurred through transaction fees. It also highlights the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain transactions, where even failed transactions become part of the historical record on the blockchain.
