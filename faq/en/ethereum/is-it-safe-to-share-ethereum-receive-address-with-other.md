# Is it safe to share Ethereum address?

Sharing Ethereum payment addresses with others can raise privacy concerns, as it allows the recipient to potentially view not only the ETH balance but also all ERC20 token balances and past transactions associated with that address.

To address these privacy considerations, some users adopt a strategy of maintaining multiple Ethereum wallets for different purposes. For instance:

1. Transaction Wallet: One wallet may be used specifically for peer-to-peer transactions. Users share this address when expecting payments from others. As this wallet is actively used in day-to-day transactions, it may have a more dynamic transaction history.

2. Long-Term Storage Wallet: Another wallet may be reserved for long-term asset storage, and it's not shared for peer-to-peer transactions. This wallet holds assets that are not actively used in transactions, and its address is kept private to minimize exposure.

By segregating wallets based on their use cases, users can enhance their privacy and control the information shared with others. This approach allows for more discreet management of financial activities while maintaining flexibility in how different wallets are utilized.
