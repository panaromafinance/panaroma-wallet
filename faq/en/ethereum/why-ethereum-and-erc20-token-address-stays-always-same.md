# Why Ethereum and ERC20 addresses are same?

You've correctly pointed out a key distinction between Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of payment addresses:

1. Ethereum Addresses:For Ethereum, the payment address associated with an individual wallet remains constant.
Regardless of incoming transactions, the Ethereum address used to receive ETH or ERC20 tokens for a specific wallet remains unchanged.

2. Bitcoin Addresses:In contrast, Bitcoin often utilizes a new address for each incoming transaction to enhance privacy.
Bitcoin wallets commonly generate a fresh payment address for each transaction, making it more challenging to link multiple transactions to the same user.

This difference in address behavior is a result of the underlying design and principles of each blockchain. Ethereum's consistent address approach is more straightforward for users who only need to share a single address for receiving ETH or ERC20 tokens. In contrast, Bitcoin's use of new addresses for each transaction aims to enhance privacy by making it harder to trace transaction history and associate multiple transactions with the same user.
