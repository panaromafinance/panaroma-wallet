# What are ERC20 tokens?

The term "cryptocurrency" typically refers to native currency units within a specific blockchain, with Bitcoin and Ethereum serving as examples of such native cryptocurrencies.

Certain blockchains, like Ethereum, offer the functionality to create additional cryptocurrencies for various purposes, commonly known as cryptocurrency tokens. Ethereum, as a platform, facilitates the development of autonomous services powered by smart contracts, resulting in a diverse range of services with different use cases. Examples include:

- Uniswap: a token exchange service
- MakerDAO: a borrowing service
- Synthetix: a derivatives trading service
- These services often issue internal cryptocurrency tokens, utilized for functions such as service governance, voting, or profit sharing. Some prominent examples include UNI for Uniswap, MKR for MakerDAO, and SNX for Synthetix.

As Ethereum gained popularity, a standardized framework for these tokens became essential, leading to the emergence of the ERC20 token standard. ERC20 tokens, which make up a significant portion of the cryptocurrency market, can be created by individuals with sufficient skills. They are traded on exchanges similar to major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. In essence, ERC20 tokens function as a decentralized equivalent of 'company shares' in the blockchain space.

The value of ERC20 tokens often depends on the capabilities they provide to their owners. For instance, a token granting the ability to claim profits from an Ethereum-based autonomous service may appreciate in value as the service gains popularity and generates profits for token holders.

The ERC20 standard defines the fundamental characteristics and capabilities that a token should possess. It outlines how token balances should be tracked, how transfers should function, and other essential features that ensure interoperability among different Ethereum-based services and tokens.
