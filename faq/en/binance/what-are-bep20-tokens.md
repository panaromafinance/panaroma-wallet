# What are BEP20 tokens?

The BEP20 standard serves as Binance Smart Chain's equivalent to Ethereum's ERC20 token standard. For those unfamiliar with the concept, more information can be found in the Ethereum section. 

Additionally, it's important to highlight that an individual's address for receiving BNB on Binance Smart Chain or any BEP20 tokens remains constant.
