# Is it Safe to share Payment address with others?

Users should share their payment address with anyone they expect to receive payments from. However, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

Public Blockchain Transparency: For blockchains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, anyone who knows your address can potentially see your entire transaction history and current token balances (ERC20, BEP20, etc.). These blockchains are fully public. 

Address Rotation: In semi-anonymous blockchains like Bitcoin and its derivatives (Bitcoin Cash, Doge, Litecoin, etc.), sharing a payment address doesn't necessarily expose your past transactions or wallet balances to the sender. Most non-custodial wallets generate a new payment address after each successful incoming payment. 

Privacy Coins: Privacy risks are minimal when using privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, Monero, or Dash. 

It's essential to be aware of the transparency level of the blockchain being used and consider the potential privacy implications when sharing payment addresses.
