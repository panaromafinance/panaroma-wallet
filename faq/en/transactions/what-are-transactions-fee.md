# What are transaction fees?

When sending cryptocurrency, the sender is obligated to pay a transaction fee to the underlying blockchain network. This fee is essential for the transaction to be accepted and incorporated into the blockchain by one of the network nodes (miners). 

The transaction fee is directly allocated to one of the random blockchain network nodes and does not in any way pass through or involve the Panaroma Decentralized wallet team.
