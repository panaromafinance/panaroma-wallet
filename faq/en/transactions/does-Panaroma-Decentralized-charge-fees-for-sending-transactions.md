# Does Panaroma Decentralized charge fees for sending transactions?

Network fees are inherent to almost all blockchain transactions. Transaction fees are a standard requirement for sending transactions on nearly every blockchain network. 

Even blockchains with high throughput generally impose minimal fees, which are typically negligible. 

It's important to note that these transaction fees are paid directly by the user to the network when executing transactions and do not pass through Panaroma Decentralized.
