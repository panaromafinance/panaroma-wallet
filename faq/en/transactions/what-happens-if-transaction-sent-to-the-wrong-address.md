# Can a transaction be canceled?

Blockchain transactions are irreversible, and once a transaction is confirmed (added to the blockchain), there is no way to cancel it. In the event of mistakenly sending a payment to an incorrect address, the only recourse is to request the recipient to return the funds. 

While a payment is still pending and has not yet been added to the blockchain, there may be potential ways to cancel it. The procedures for doing so for Bitcoin and Ethereum are explained in the sections below. 

The Panaroma Decentralized wallet is equipped to validate destination addresses and issue warnings to senders if the entered destination address does not match the typical format for a payment address on that blockchain. For example, the wallet prevents sending Bitcoin to an Ethereum address. Additionally, Panaroma Decentralized can alert the sender if they mistype or enter an incomplete payment address.
