# How does Panaroma Decentralized Wallet calculate transaction fees? 

The Panaroma Decentralized wallet app is designed to suggest the optimal transaction fee at any given moment. The entire fee amount, 100%, is directly allocated to the network nodes and is not associated with Panaroma Decentralized wallet. 

Panaroma Decentralized does not impose any additional fees for sending, receiving, or swapping cryptocurrencies. 

The transaction fee recommendation algorithms employed by Panaroma Decentralized rely on estimates derived from recent blockchain activity. If a user chooses a fee considered low, Panaroma Decentralized provides a warning that the transaction may experience delays and remain pending for hours or even days. 

It is advisable to set higher fees when sending a substantial amount or when a quick transaction processing is required. A higher fee enhances the likelihood of faster transaction processing.
