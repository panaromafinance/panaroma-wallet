# How do you delete (unlink) the wallet?

To remove wallets and associated data from the Panaroma Decentralized wallet, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Settings and locate the Manage Wallets section.

- Click on the 'more' button next to the specific wallet you want to remove to access its settings.

- Within the wallet's settings screen, use the 'unlink' button to initiate the removal process.

By following these steps, the wallet will be deleted from the Panaroma Decentralized app, and all of its data will be erased as if it never existed. It's essential to note that this action does not delete wallet transactions or balances from the blockchain, and such data remains intact.

The 'unlink' action specifically deletes the private key that controls the wallet from the Panaroma Decentralized app. It's crucial to keep in mind that restoring deleted wallets in the future requires the user to have the private key (mnemonic phrase) for each wallet, along with its passphrase if applicable. Attempting to restore access to a deleted wallet without knowing its private key (mnemonic phrase) is not possible.
