# How do you manage multiple wallets?

Panaroma Decentralized simplifies the seamless management of an unlimited number of multi-coin crypto wallets. 

Users have the flexibility to handle and utilize numerous wallets, each functioning as a distinct asset portfolio. For example, one wallet might be dedicated to long-term investments, while another is designated for daily payments.  

On Panaroma Decentralized, the Balance tab consistently displays the actively selected wallet. Users can effortlessly switch between activated wallets through various methods: 

- Utilize the wallet switcher button situated in the top left corner of the Balance tab. 

- Access Manage Wallets from the Settings screen within the wallet app. 

- Employ a double-click (iOS) or tap-and-hold (Android) on the Balance tab icon while on the Balance screen. 

- When managing multiple wallets, it is essential for users to complete the backup procedure for all enabled wallets. 

 
Tip! For users intending to operate multiple wallets, setting up an unlimited number of wallets with the same mnemonic phrase (private key) but employing different passphrases for each wallet can enhance the ease of managing, operating, and backing up wallets.
