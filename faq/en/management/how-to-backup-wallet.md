# How do you backup a wallet(s)?

Ensuring wallet backup is a critical step, and users are strongly advised to follow these instructions for each wallet in the Panaroma Decentralized app:

- Navigate to Settings and locate the Manage Wallets section within the app.

- Identify wallets without completed backup procedures, which are marked with a red alert icon.

- Click on the 'more' button next to the wallet name to access its settings.

- Within the wallet's settings screen, select the "Backup Wallet" option.

- Follow the provided backup steps to complete the process.

It's important to note that funds cannot be received in a wallet that has not undergone the backup procedure. While this may be perceived as inconvenient by some users, this measure is implemented to minimize instances where users operate wallets without having proper backups in place.

The backup procedure for each wallet involves the critical step of recording a private key, presented in the form of a 12-24 word mnemonic phrase, for the respective wallet.

A crucial cautionary note is emphasized: saving a screenshot of the private key for the wallet is not considered a secure practice. This is due to the potential risk that any third-party application with access to a device's photo library (such as social apps) could potentially access and share that screenshot with unauthorized entities. Users are strongly advised to follow secure backup practices to safeguard their wallet information.
