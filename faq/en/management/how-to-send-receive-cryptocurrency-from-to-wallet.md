# How do you send/receive cryptocurrency to/from the wallet?

Most non-custodial wallets share a similar design for sending or receiving cryptocurrencies. 

For detailed guidance on Bitcoin or Ethereum transfers, please refer to the respective sections below. 
  
To receive or deposit cryptocurrency: 

- Start by activating the coin on the Balance tab using the 'add coin' button if it's not already active. 

- Navigate to the Balance tab and obtain the receive/deposit address for the coin by clicking on the 'receive' icon button in the coin cell. 

- The resulting screen displays the user's payment address for that coin. When someone sends the coin to that address, the funds will appear on the wallet's Balance tab. 

- Double-check the payment address before providing it to other entities to ensure accuracy. Once a payment is made to an incorrect address, it cannot be canceled. 

To send cryptocurrency: 

- Click on the cryptocurrency coin on the Balance tab and proceed with the 'send' button. 

- Provide the destination address (payment address of the recipient), enter the amount, and set the fee value for the transaction. For user convenience, the input field for the amount allows specifying the amount in fiat equivalent. 

- Click 'proceed' for the final confirmation screen. Pay attention to the values on that screen and ensure the amounts being sent are correct. 

Confirm the transaction to send it to the blockchain for processing.
