# How do you restore a wallet(s)?

Panaroma Decentralized offers a convenient wallet restoration feature for any wallet created in a standard-compliant format, whether it was set up in Panaroma Decentralized or other non-custodial wallet apps. 

To restore a wallet: 

- Navigate to Settings >> Manage Wallets section. 

- Click on the 'Restore' button. 

- Enter the mnemonic phrase for the wallet. If there's an additional passphrase (BIP39), provide it as well. 

On the subsequent screen, choose the currencies to activate for the wallet. Opting for Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain also enables auto-activation of all ERC20/BEP20 tokens with a balance. Manually select all blockchains where the wallet is expected to have a balance. 

After currency selection, click 'Restore' and wait for the wallet to synchronize with the chosen blockchains, identifying past transactions. 

Synchronization for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, and Zcash may take several minutes or hours, depending on various factors, including internet connectivity. 

Additional considerations: 

- For Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin, specify the address type for the selected coin. Detailed information is available in the Bitcoin section below. 

- When restoring Zcash wallets, users can optionally indicate the wallet birthday height parameter to significantly expedite the synchronization process. 

Privacy-conscious users should note that Panaroma Decentralized, by default, synchronizes wallets restored via a 3rd-party API server. This occurs only once during wallet restoration and is faster but generally considered less private. Users preferring decentralized synchronization with the blockchain can opt for 'via Blockchain,' a more private method that may take a few hours.
