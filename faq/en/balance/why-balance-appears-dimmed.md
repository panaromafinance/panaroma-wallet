# Why does the balance appear dimmed?

The wallet balance value may appear faded in instances where the app lacks access to the latest cryptocurrency exchange rates. Generally, cryptocurrency rates are deemed outdated if they surpass a 10-minute threshold. 

Additionally, the balance value might also be dimmed when one or more cryptocurrencies within the Balance tab are undergoing synchronization with the blockchain.  

In typical usage scenarios, a momentary dimming of the balance is expected during app launch as the wallet concludes synchronization tasks. 

It's important to note that if any of the coins lack a current exchange rate, they will not contribute to the total balance amount displayed on the Balance tab.
