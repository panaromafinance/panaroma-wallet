# Why is the wallet balance showing an incorrect amount?

There are several scenarios in which the wallet balance may display an incorrect amount: 

Missing Exchange Rate: 
- If the exchange rate for a particular cryptocurrency is unavailable, its value will not be reflected in the total balance amount. 

Incorrect Exchange Rate: 
- If the exchange rate for a cryptocurrency is incorrect, both the displayed balance for that coin and the total balance amount will be inaccurate. 

Blockchain Synchronization: 

- During app synchronization with the blockchain, the balances for individual coins and the total balance amount may fluctuate based on the synchronization progress. 

Pending Transactions: 
- If there is an incoming transaction that has not yet reached finality, the balance may temporarily change. Certain currencies, like Bitcoin, require a specific amount of time for recently received funds to become spendable. This duration varies, typically ranging from a few minutes to an hour, depending on the cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin requires 3 blocks to pass (approximately 30 minutes) before Panaroma Decentralized allows spending newly received Bitcoins. 

Identification Issues: 
- Occasionally, the balance amount for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, and Zcash may be inaccurately displayed due to the Panaroma Decentralized wallet's failure to correctly identify an incoming transaction. In such cases, users are encouraged to report the issue to the Panaroma Decentralized team, and a resolution will be prioritized.
