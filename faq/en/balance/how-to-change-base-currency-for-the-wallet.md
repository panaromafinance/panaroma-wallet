# How to change base currency?

Panaroma Decentralized Wallet presents balance and transaction amounts in USD as the default base currency, allowing users to switch to a different fiat currency in the wallet settings. Exchange rates for crypto-to-fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) are sourced from a third-party service, specifically coingecko.com.

It's important to note that while Panaroma Decentralized collaborates with trustworthy data providers, the wallet cannot ensure that the returned rates are consistently real-time and valid. Users should exercise caution, particularly when dealing with substantial sums, and be aware that exchange rates may fluctuate.
