# What does the 'syncing' status on a coin mean?

The 'syncing' status indicator on a coin signifies that the Panaroma Decentralized app is attempting to synchronize itself with a specific blockchain. 

Although, in most instances, the 'syncing' status is expected to be brief, there are valid situations where it may persist for a more extended period: 

Initial Synchronization: 
During the initial synchronization when restoring a wallet with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, or Zcash cryptocurrencies. This process may take several hours for each coin if the user opts to restore the wallet from the blockchain instead of using a third-party API service. The duration increases with the number of coins being restored. 

First-time Activation: 
- When activating Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, and Zcash cryptocurrencies for the first time after wallet setup. 

Periods of Inactivity: 
- When opening the wallet app after days or weeks of inactivity. 

Network Conditions:  
- Under poor networking conditions or generally slow internet. 

RPC Provider Response Delays:  
- In cases of delayed or slow response times for Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain RPC providers. It is advisable to wait for a few minutes or attempt to restart the wallet app. 

It's important to note that the Panaroma Decentralized app only continues the synchronization process when the app is open. If the app is closed, the synchronization process is paused and resumes only when the app is opened again.
