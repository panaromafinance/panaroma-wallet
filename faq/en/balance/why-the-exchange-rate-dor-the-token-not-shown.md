# Why is the exchange rate for the token not shown?

Panaroma Decentralized obtains token exchange rates from various third-party sources that monitor cryptocurrency market prices in real-time. This allows users to access up-to-date information on the current value of their tokens.

It's important to note that the availability of current and historical rates may vary, especially for newly launched tokens. In instances where data for specific tokens is not readily accessible or is limited,  Panaroma Decentralized may not display the exchange rate for those particular coins.

This approach is common in the cryptocurrency industry, as newly launched tokens may not have established trading histories or widespread market coverage. Users should be aware of this limitation and consider it when using  Panaroma Decentralized for real-time market information, particularly for tokens with less established market presence.
