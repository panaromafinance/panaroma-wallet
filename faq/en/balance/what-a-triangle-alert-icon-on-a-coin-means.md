# What does a triangle alert icon on a coin mean?

The triangular alert icon displayed on a coin indicates that the Panaroma Decentralized app encountered difficulties in synchronizing with the respective blockchain. 

1. For Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, or Zcash coins, users can attempt to resolve the issue by clicking on the alert icon. Subsequently, they can explore the available action buttons for options like retry or changing the synchronization source. If the sync error persists, another option is to delete the wallet and attempt a fresh restoration. 

2. If the icon surfaces on Ethereum (including ERC20 tokens) or Binance Smart Chain (including BEP20 tokens), the issue likely stems from communication errors with Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain data providers. Typically, retrying the sync after waiting for a few minutes resolves the problem. If not, users may consider restarting the app. 

It's crucial to note that a synchronization error indicates challenges in the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app's synchronization with the blockchain, and it does not impact the funds on the wallet balance in any way.
