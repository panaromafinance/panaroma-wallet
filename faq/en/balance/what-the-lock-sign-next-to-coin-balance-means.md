# What a lock icon on coin balance means?

Panaroma Decentralized Wallet incorporates a lock icon beneath the coin balance in situations where the wallet cannot utilize the entire balance for a specific coin. This occurs, for example, when the wallet receives a time-locked Bitcoin transaction that is restricted from being spent until a predetermined future date. In such instances, Panaroma Decentralized Wallet adeptly recognizes these transactions, highlighting the section of the coin balance with a lock icon. This visual cue effectively communicates to users that a portion of the coin is temporarily inaccessible due to time constraints.
