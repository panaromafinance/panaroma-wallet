# Why are there random token balances appearing in my wallet?

It's not uncommon for emerging cryptocurrency projects to distribute tokens through 'airdrops,' a process of giving away tokens to the community. Airdrops serve various purposes, such as attracting community interest and broadening token distribution. However, some projects may conduct airdrops solely for spamming purposes. 

While certain projects target specific users based on criteria, others may opt to distribute tokens to anyone holding Ethereum cryptocurrency. Since Ethereum addresses are public on the blockchain, anyone can send ETH and/or tokens to these addresses without prerequisites. 

While users occasionally receive valuable tokens through airdrops, such as Uniswap or 1inch tokens that may appreciate in value rapidly, a significant portion of airdropped tokens holds no value and can be disregarded.
