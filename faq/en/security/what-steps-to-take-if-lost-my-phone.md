# What steps should I to take if I lose my phone

In situations where a phone with the wallet app is lost or no longer accessible, the wallet owner can acquire a new device and regain access to the wallet on the new device. 

However, if the original device lacked the unlock code mechanism for both the device and/or the wallet app, or if easily guessable unlock codes (e.g., 000000 or 123456) were employed, it is recommended to: 

- Restore the old wallet on the new device. 

- Establish a new wallet on the new device. 

- Transfer funds from the old wallet to the new wallet.
