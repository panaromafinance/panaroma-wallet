# What is a mnemonic phrase?

When a user creates a wallet in a non-custodial wallet app, the app typically prompts the user to back up the associated private key. This private key is often presented in the form of a 12 or 24-word list, commonly known as a mnemonic phrase or seed.

To enhance security, wallet owners are advised to store this phrase offline and use it for wallet restoration in scenarios like smartphone loss or theft. However, keeping the mnemonic phrase offline comes with its own set of risks. If the phrase is discovered by someone aware of its purpose, there's a potential threat of unauthorized access and theft of wallet funds.

To mitigate this risk, one effective strategy is to bolster private key security by incorporating a mnemonic passphrase.  Panaroma Decentralized Wallet app offers this feature, allowing users to add an extra layer of protection to their private keys and further enhance the security of their cryptocurrency holdings.
