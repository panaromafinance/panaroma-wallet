# Why should an unlock code be set for the wallet app?

Nearly all non-custodial wallet types, including Panaroma Decentralized, incorporate measures to safeguard cryptocurrency funds in the event that the device falls into unauthorized hands. 

While the unlock code feature in Panaroma Decentralized is optional, it is strongly advised to activate it for the wallet app. This feature is designed to render private keys inaccessible even if an unauthorized entity possesses the wallet device and attempts to gain access using specialized tools. For the same security rationale, it is also recommended to enable the unlock code for the mobile device itself.  

As a standard security practice, it is advisable to use a distinct unlock code for unlocking the mobile device and the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app.
