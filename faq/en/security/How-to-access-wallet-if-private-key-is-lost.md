# How to access wallet if private key is lost? 

Accessing wallet funds within Panaroma Decentralized relies on possessing the private key or its mnemonic phrase, typically consisting of 12-24 words. Panaroma Decentralized serves as a gateway for users to engage with blockchains and manage their cryptocurrencies. Control and spending capabilities on these blockchains are facilitated by the wallet's private keys, securely maintained within the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app. Importantly, these private keys are never transmitted outside the app and remain solely in the user's possession.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure the backup and protection of these keys to prevent unauthorized access. Consequently, Panaroma Decentralized cannot:

Recover a lost wallet private key for the user.
Cancel user transactions or have visibility into them.
Interfere with user tokens or the wallet app in any manner.
Users are encouraged to exercise diligence in safeguarding their private keys to maintain control and security over their cryptocurrency holdings within the Panaroma Decentralized wallet.
