# How do you use a mnemonic passphrase?

The use of a mnemonic passphrase in the  Panaroma Decentralized app adds an extra layer of security to the wallet, enhancing protection against unauthorized access even if the mnemonic phrase is somehow obtained by an unauthorized entity.

One notable feature in the  Panaroma Decentralized app is the ability for users to create multiple wallets that share the same mnemonic phrase but have different mnemonic passphrases. This creative and convenient approach enables users to manage multiple cryptocurrency wallets securely. Each wallet may have the same underlying mnemonic phrase but is uniquely protected by its own passphrase.

For instance:

- Wallet 1: mnemonic + passphrase1
- Wallet 2: mnemonic + passphrase2
- Wallet 3: mnemonic + passphrase3
...
In the event that an unauthorized entity gains access to the mnemonic phrase, the passphrases act as the primary security measure preventing access to the wallets. Without knowledge of the passphrases, it becomes nearly impossible for an unauthorized individual to access these wallets or even determine their existence.

It's crucial to emphasize that the security of a wallet, in case of a compromised mnemonic phrase, heavily relies on the strength of the chosen passphrase. To enhance security, the passphrase should not be a simple, easily guessable English word but rather a combination of letters and numbers, with longer passphrases generally providing stronger protection.

In practice, if a wallet's mnemonic phrase is compromised, it is advisable to migrate to a new wallet. The passphrase acts as a safeguard, providing the wallet owner with enough time to transfer funds to a new wallet before any potential security risks escalate. The proactive measure of migrating funds to a new wallet helps maintain the security and integrity of the user's assets in the cryptocurrency space.
