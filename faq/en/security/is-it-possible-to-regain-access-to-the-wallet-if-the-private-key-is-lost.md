# How to access wallet if private key is lost? 

Accessing wallet funds is contingent upon having access to the private key or its mnemonic phrase representation in the form of 12-24 words. 

Panaroma Decentralized serves as a gateway, facilitating user interactions with blockchains and the cryptocurrencies within them. Control and spending capabilities on these blockchains are enabled through wallet private keys, securely housed within Panaroma Decentralized wallets. Importantly, these private keys never leave the Panaroma Decentralized wallet app and remain exclusively in the hands of users. 

He responsibility lies with the user to ensure the backup and protection of these keys from unauthorized entities. Consequently, Panaroma Decentralized cannot: 

 - Recover a lost wallet private key for the user. 

 - Cancel user transactions or be aware of them. 

 - Interfere with user tokens or the wallet app in any manner.
