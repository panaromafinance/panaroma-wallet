# Are Bitcoin transactions private?

Bitcoin transactions offer a higher level of privacy compared to Ethereum due to the ability to use unique addresses for each incoming payment. Panaroma Decentralized wallet further enhances this privacy by automatically changing the deposit address after each payment, making it more challenging for external entities to link a user's balance and past transactions  

As with Ethereum, users can adopt good privacy practices when using Bitcoin, including the use of multiple wallets for different purposes: 
  
- Long-term storage wallet: A rarely-used wallet specifically for long-term storage that avoids transactions with entities collecting data. 

- Exchange interaction wallet: A wallet dedicated to transactions with centralized exchanges and other data-collecting entities. 

- Peer-to-peer transaction wallet: A wallet specifically for transacting with individuals. 


Additionally, Panaroma Decentralized and similar wallets may provide advanced privacy features related to transaction structuring, contributing to a more secure and private Bitcoin usage experience. While Bitcoin transactions are transparent, thoughtful practices can significantly enhance user privacy.
