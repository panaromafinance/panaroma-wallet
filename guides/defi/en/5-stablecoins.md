# Stablecoins in DeFi:

## 1. Introduction:
Stablecoins were among the pioneering decentralized financial instruments in the DeFi ecosystem. These cryptocurrencies aim to maintain a stable value by pegging it to external assets such as USD, EUR, gold, or other cryptocurrencies. DeFi smart contracts have played a crucial role in creating stablecoins with fixed values, making them less susceptible to the price volatility seen in other cryptocurrencies.

## 2. Mechanisms for Stability:

- **Smart Contract Programming:**
  Stablecoins utilize smart contracts with various mechanisms to ensure their price closely follows the peg.

- **Price Stability:**
  Stablecoins maintain a fixed value, often equal to 1 USD or a specific amount of gold, shielding them from the price swings associated with other cryptocurrencies.

## 3. Specifics of Stablecoins:

### DAI:

- **Governance:**
  DAI is decentralized and governed by smart contracts without privileged parties.

- **Autonomy:**
  It adheres to DeFi principles, and its functionality is largely autonomous.

### USDT:

- **Centralization:**
  USDT is centralized, where privileged parties (Tether Limited) can add or freeze tokens at will.

- **Liquidity:**
