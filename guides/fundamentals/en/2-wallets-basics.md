# Wallets Explained

Cryptocurrency, by its nature, provides owners with capabilities not found in traditional financial instruments. Understanding these capabilities is crucial for those seeking secure storage and accumulation of cryptocurrencies.

- In traditional finance, assets are typically held by a custodian on behalf of the user, with the custodian having full control. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, allow users to be the sole custodian of their assets, eliminating dependence on intermediaries.

For individuals looking to securely store and accumulate crypto assets, it is vital to comprehend how ownership functions in the realm of cryptocurrencies.

## How Ownership Works

Most cryptocurrencies operate on their specific blockchains. The concept of owning Bitcoin or Ethereum differs significantly from traditional cash in a wallet.

> **Ownership in cryptocurrency refers to possessing a cryptographic key that can spend a certain amount of cryptocurrency.**

When someone claims to have 5 Bitcoins, it means they possess a cryptographic key capable of spending 5 Bitcoins.

Transferring 1 Bitcoin to another person involves the sender using their cryptographic key to sign off 1 Bitcoin from their balance, transferring ownership to the recipient. After the transaction, only the recipient's cryptographic key can spend that 1 Bitcoin.

In essence, owning a certain amount of crypto translates to owning a specific cryptographic key.

The private key, resembling something like:

> **5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF**

Revealing or losing this key means losing access to the controlled crypto, as it is practically impossible to guess, even with the most powerful computers trying for over a billion years.

In practical terms, the private key serves as a secure alternative to traditional username and password authentication, without the ability to recover if lost.

## Cryptocurrency Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets function as tools to hold and manage cryptographic keys.

> **Wallets do not physically store cryptocurrencies; instead, they store cryptographic keys capable of controlling a certain amount of cryptocurrencies.**

Genuine cryptocurrency wallets enable safe and private key storage. It's crucial to note that cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms, with some providers offering pseudo wallets that lack genuine control over assets.

When evaluating wallets, the core principle to focus on is unconditional ownership.

### 1) Non-Custodial Wallets

Non-custodial wallets provide users with exclusive control over their funds, making them theoretically the most secure. The wallet provider has no control over user assets, and users have full responsibility for their crypto assets.

> **Users of non-custodial wallets must understand that funds in the wallet are under exclusive control, giving them both full control and full responsibility.**

This is the recommended type of wallet for safe storage.

### 2) Custodial Wallets

Custodial wallets do not grant users exclusive control over crypto funds; instead, the wallet provider manages transactions on behalf of the user. These wallets are the least secure, as the wallet provider has full control over user funds.

> **Wallet providers can block user access or freeze funds, posing significant risks for users holding large amounts of cryptocurrency.**

Custodial wallets are not private, as the provider has access to the user's full transaction history. It's advised not to use wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges for extended periods.

### 3) Hybrid Wallets

Hybrid wallets require approval from both the owner and the provider before funds can be spent. While they protect against hacking by the wallet provider, they open the door for censorship in certain scenarios.

Only non-custodial wallets ensure that funds are under the user's control without dependence on any third party.
