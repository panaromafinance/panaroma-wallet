# Spending Cryptocurrency: Exploring Options

While widespread acceptance of cryptocurrency as a direct payment method is still evolving, there are alternative ways to spend your digital assets. Here are some practical methods:

## Crypto Debit Cards:

- Several companies offer debit cards linked to your cryptocurrency balance.
- These cards can be used wherever Visa, MasterCard, etc., are accepted.
- Transactions are conducted as with a regular card, and you can also withdraw cash from ATMs.
- Debit amount is deducted from your crypto wallet balance based on current market rates.
- Additional fees or perks like cashback rewards may apply, depending on the card provider.
- Popular crypto debit card providers include Crypterium, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Cash.app, Cryptopay, and 2gether.

### What To Know:

- Debit card providers typically issue a custodial cryptocurrency wallet for card transactions.
- It's advisable not to keep substantial funds in the custodial wallet.
- Use a non-custodial wallet for your primary funds and occasionally transfer amounts to the card provider's wallet for short-term spending.
- Most crypto debit card providers require identification documents for verification.

While spending directly with cryptocurrency is not yet mainstream, crypto debit cards provide a bridge, allowing users to enjoy the convenience of card transactions while utilizing their digital assets. Always be mindful of fees, perks, and security considerations when opting for such services.
