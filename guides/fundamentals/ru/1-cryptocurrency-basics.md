# Cryptocurrency Basics: A Quick Guide

The purpose of this guide is to bring someone with limited knowledge about cryptocurrencies up to speed as quickly as possible.

Cryptocurrencies rely on several technologies, with blockchain being the primary one.

The inception of blockchain technology occurred with the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Utilizing this technology made it feasible to establish an accessible platform for value exchange, eliminating the possibility of actions beyond agreed-upon rules.

When utilizing a product built on such a blockchain, the following statements hold true:

- Users don't need to trust anyone.
- Users don't require permission to participate.
- Users have unconditional control over their assets.
- Blockchain records are immutable.

Blockchain technology has the potential to be applied wherever trust, censorship resistance, and immutability are crucial, such as in notary services or elections.

Presently, many financial and legal agencies enforce matters that could be handled impartially by a blockchain. If blockchain technology continues to grow, these services may transition to blockchain platforms.

The first generation of blockchain-based products, like Bitcoin, aims to provide a financial platform for value exchange without relying on intermediaries like banks. In this context, Bitcoin was the pioneer in applying the idea of blockchain to challenge areas currently controlled by the financial system.

## Blockchain Attributes

So, what exactly is a blockchain? While many definitions make it sound complex, it's quite simple in reality.

Without getting too technical, think of a blockchain as a chronological history of records. It could be a history of transactions, votes submitted in elections, and so on.

While the actual history of records isn't inherently special, placing it on a blockchain imparts certain attributes that make it socially valuable. These attributes include:

- **Distributed Nature:**
  The history of records isn't centralized; it's held in thousands of locations simultaneously, updated almost in real time.

- **Peer-to-peer Transmission:**
  Anyone can add new records by communicating with any entity that maintains the records, ensuring 24/7 availability and unconditional access to participation.

- **Transparency & Pseudonymity:**
  Blockchains are generally transparent, with the entire history of records accessible to the public. While records are public, the involved entities remain masked.

- **Irreversibility Of Records:**
  Blockchains are designed so that once an action takes place, it's impossible to change it, ensuring the integrity of the history of records.

- **Business Logic:**
  Blockchains allow adding conditional logic to records, going beyond a regular history of transactions. For example, specifying that certain funds can't be spent for a set period.

So, blockchains are more than just a plain history of records; the technology enables society to organize and exchange without relying on a third party.

## Blockchains Are Free

Generally, blockchains have open-source code, allowing anyone to reuse it for various purposes. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are open source, continuously improved by a global community of engineers.

While initially created by a small group, major blockchain projects are now driven by a large group of independent engineers. It's impossible for any party to shut down or censor a blockchain network like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Cryptocurrencies Explained

Now, let's delve into the basic nature of cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies are units on a blockchain, and their characteristics vary based on the underlying blockchain.

For example:

- **Bitcoin (BTC):**
  The native unit on the Bitcoin blockchain, divisible into 100 million sub-units called Satoshi. The Bitcoin blockchain caps the total amount at 21 million Bitcoins, mainly recording transactions.

- **Ether (ETH):**
  The native unit on the Ethereum blockchain, divisible into wei. Ethereum doesn't cap the amount of Ether, and its blockchain doesn't limit the type of records it can hold.

Some blockchains, like Ethereum, allow creating custom 'units of something' known as cryptocurrency tokens, constituting 80-90% of all cryptocurrencies.

## How Cryptocurrencies Grow

Many wonder why there are numerous cryptocurrencies and why some are more popular or expensive than others.

While some cryptocurrencies are unique in their underlying blockchain, many are duplicates. As blockchains have open code, anyone can launch a duplicate cryptocurrency, which, apart from network size, isn't substantially different from the original.

The size of the network is crucial; more participants enhance security and decentralization. The more people interacting with a blockchain, the more attractive it becomes for service providers.

For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain started as a small project in 2009 but has grown into a global, censorship-resistant platform open to all. The key element in evaluating a blockchain is its network size, making the most valuable cryptocurrency the one with the biggest network, not necessarily the one with the most features.
